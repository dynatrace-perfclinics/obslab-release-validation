A product manager informs you that they're ready to release their new feature to the world. They ask you to enable the feature and run the load test test in a dev environment.

They tell you that the new feature is behind a flag called `paymentServiceFailure` (yes, an obvious name for this demo) and they tell you to change the `defaultValue` from `off` to `on`.

## Update the Feature Flag and Inform Dynatrce

Run the following script which:

- Notifies Dynatrace using a `CUSTOM_INFO` event of the change inc. the new value and the remediation info should a problem occur
- Changes the `defaultValue` of the `paymentServiceFailure` feature flag to `on`
- Applies the configuration change

```
./runtimeChange.sh paymentServiceFailure on off
```

# Enable Automatic Baselining for Site Reliability Guardian

Objectives that are set to "auto baseline" in Dynatrace Site Reliability Guardians require `5` runs in order to enable the baselines.

In a real scenario, these test runs would likely be spread over hours, days or weeks. This provides Dynatrace with ample time to gather sufficient usage data.

For demo purposes, 5 seperate "load tests" will be triggered in quick succession to enable the baselining.

First, apply the load test script:

```
kubectl apply -f .devcontainer/k6/k6-load-test-script.yaml
```

## Trigger the First Load Test

```
kubectl apply -f .devcontainer/k6/k6-srg-training-run1.yaml
```

## Trigger the Second Load Test

Wait a few seconds and trigger the second load test:

```
kubectl apply -f .devcontainer/k6/k6-srg-training-run2.yaml
```

## Trigger the Third Load Test

Wait a few seconds and trigger the third load test:

```
kubectl apply -f .devcontainer/k6/k6-srg-training-run3.yaml
```
## Trigger the Fourth Load Test

Wait a few seconds and trigger the fourth load test:

```
kubectl apply -f .devcontainer/k6/k6-srg-training-run4.yaml
```

## Trigger the Final Training Load Test

Wait a few seconds and trigger the final (fifth) load test:

```
kubectl apply -f .devcontainer/k6/k6-srg-training-run5.yaml
```

## Wait for Completion

Each load test runs for 1 minute so keep running the following command until you see all jobs listed as `Complete`:

```
kubectl get jobs
```

```
âžœ /workspaces/obslab-release-validation (main) $ kubectl get jobs
NAME               STATUS     COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
k6-training-run1   Complete   1/1           95s        2m2s
k6-training-run2   Complete   1/1           93s        115s
k6-training-run3   Complete   1/1           93s        108s
k6-training-run4   Complete   1/1           90s        100s
k6-training-run5   Complete   1/1           84s        94s
```

## View Completed Training Runs

In Dynatrace, go to workflows and select `Executions`. You should see 5 successful workflow executions:

### View SRG Status using DQL

You can also use this DQL to see the Site Reliability Guardian results in a notebook:

```
fetch bizevents
| filter event.provider == "dynatrace.site.reliability.guardian"
| filter event.type == "guardian.validation.finished"
| fieldsKeep guardian.id, validation.id, timestamp, guardian.name, validation.status, validation.summary, validation.from, validation.to
```

![dynatrace view SRG results in a notebook](images/dt-notebook-view-srg-results.png)
The automatic baselines for the guardian are now enabled. You can proceed to use the guardian for "real" evaluations.
